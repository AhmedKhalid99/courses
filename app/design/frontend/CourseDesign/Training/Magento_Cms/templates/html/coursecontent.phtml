      We understand — sometimes you only want to learn specific topics, not the full course.
      That’s why we’ve made it possible to purchase selected parts individually (when available), so you:

      <li><span class="emoji">✅</span> Only pay for what matters to you</li>
      <li><span class="emoji">🔍</span> Explore available parts before buying</li>
      <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> Customize your learning journey</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
