    <ul class="benefits-list">
      <li><span class="emoji">✅</span> Only pay for what matters to you</li>
      <li><span class="emoji">🔍</span> Explore available parts before buying</li>
      <li><span class="emoji">💡</span> Customize your learning journey</li>

    <p class="note">
      Some parts might not be sold separately — so make sure to check the outline before you buy.
